Essentially it the the Marc Okrand's Atlantean with a some modifications. 
A through M is now
N through Z and
N through Z is now
A through M
I did that so that the O is the character is the one that looks like it might be The Devil's sigil not B. (B is swapped with O)
Also Z were replaced with O superimposed on top its horizontal flipping of its self. So Z is the Greater-O and O is the lesser-Z. (O <=|=> Z)
If you find the meaning of the relation between the B's, O's and Z's please keep it to yourself for the cosmos' sake.
